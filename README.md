# mpcButtonJukebox
A python script for running a Jukebox with a raspberry pi 5 that uses song numbers to add songs to the mpc queue and displays album art in a gtk window

Other scripts for running a jukebox from a raspberry pi use a touch screen to select songs. I wanted to be able to pick the songs using the buttons on the jukebox so I cobbled this together. 

I'm not programmer so this was greatly assisted by chatgpt and other ai tools.
