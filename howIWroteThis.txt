I'm not a programmer. I'm also not willing to pay for AI. But I've been using AI to help me write a 400 or so line python script and it has been invaluable because while I know how to write a basic script, I don't know about all the libraries that you can include to do things. So instead of spending days trying to reinvent the wheel, I can tell Chatgpt or Claude what I want to do and it will spit out something that will at least get me in the right direction. 

I have learned to diff whatever the AI gives me against what I already have though because whichever AI I use will often just leave things out. Before I got wise to this I would spend way too long trying to figure out why some 2 line change the AI gave me would break something totally unrelated. 

Now that I'm at the point where the script is basically finished, I've started pitting the AI against one another. For example, I will as Claude if it has any suggestions for improvements and then ask Chatgpt if it thinks the suggestions are worthwhile. Then I will go back to Claude and tell it "Chatgpt says this suggestion is unnecessary because of X. Do you agree?" Then I can judge if I want to bother making the change.
